      <h3 class="green-text">Project 1: Responsive Website</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and developed a responsive website for a local business using

      <h3 class="green-text">Project 2: E-commerce Platform</h3>
      <p>
        For this project, I worked with a team to create a custom e-commerce
        platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a back-end framework. The
        platform allows customers to browse products, add items to their cart,
        and complete purchases.
